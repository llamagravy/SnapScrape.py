# SnapScrape.py
Downloads public Snapchat stories, profile picture, bio, backdrop image, and highlights in your system.

## Saving this locally
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/llamagravy/SnapScrape.py.git
$ pip3 install -r SnapScrape.py.git/requirements.txt
```

## Run it
```bash
# Change to this directory & Make the script executable.
$ cd SnapScrape.py.git && chmod +x SnapScrape.py

# Run the script.
$ python3 SnapScrape.py

# Alternative way to run.
$ python3 SnapScrape.py <USERNAME>
```
## Planned additions
Plan to add flags with arguments for:  
• Custom output directory  
• Disabling file extension detection  
• Getting specific collections i.e. only Curated Highlights or Story  
  
Other:  
• Separate folders for story and curated highlights  
• Add support for saving Lenses and Spotlight highlight  
• Prevent download attempt when profile is unchanged   
• Forced download of private profile's profile picture, background image, etc  

## Use it
Just enter one username which has a Public Profile.  
It saves the media in current directory in a Folder named after given username.  


## Heads Up
Made by exploring Python. Inspired by similiar programms. Use at own risk.

## Use it to archive important things, be polite and cause no harm.
